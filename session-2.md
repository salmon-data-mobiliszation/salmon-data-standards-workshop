:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How can I make sure others understand and correctly use my terms?
- What makes a good definition or label?
- How should I record units, examples, and relationships between terms?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Extract and describe terms from their dataset.
- Write unambiguous, well-structured definitions.
- Record associated metadata (units, codes, examples).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor
1. Concept: What Makes a Good Definition? (15 min)
Show two examples:
❌ “Run timing: when fish come back.”
✅ “Run timing: The seasonal period during which adult salmon return from the ocean to their natal freshwater spawning areas.”
Discuss why clarity, precision, and context matter.

2. Demonstration: Documenting a Term (10 min)
Instructor walks through one dataset column, filling in the template:

Label: brood_year

Definition: “The calendar year when the majority of parental salmon spawned.”

Unit: “Year (YYYY)”

Example: “2017”

Notes: “Equivalent to term in DFO Salmon Concept Scheme.”

3. Activity: Extract and define (40 min)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Challenge 1: Extract and define (40 min)

Goal: Create clear, consistent documentation for your own dataset terms.

Review your dataset and list 10–15 column names. Record in a shared data dictionary template (CSV):

- Label (term name)

- Definition (clear, context-rich description)

- Units or codes used

- Example value(s)

- Notes on ambiguity or uncertainty

4. Discussion: Patterns and Pitfalls (15 min)

Which terms were hardest to define?

Were there local abbreviations or codes that need clarification?

How can we document uncertainty? (e.g., “derived from visual estimate”).

5. Reflection (10 min)
Connect to next steps:

A well-documented data dictionary is the foundation for term alignment.

Later modules will link these definitions to others via mappings.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

## Expected Outputs

- A draft data dictionary covering at least 10 key terms.

- Peer-reviewed feedback on definition clarity.

- Improved awareness of semantic gaps in existing data.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints
- A data dictionary is the bridge between raw data and understanding.
- Good definitions reduce misinterpretation and support machine processing.
- Documentation is both a social and technical task.
