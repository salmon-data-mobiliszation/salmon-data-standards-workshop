## How to Contribute

We provide multiple pathways for contributing based on your comfort level with Git and GitHub:

### üåü Option A: Quick Edits via GitHub Web Interface

This is the easiest way to contribute if you're new to Git/GitHub or just want to make a quick fix.

#### For Episode Files (R Markdown files in the `episodes/` folder):

1. **Navigate to the file** you want to edit:

   - Go to the [episodes folder](https://github.com/salmon-data-mobilization/salmon-data-standards-workshop/tree/main/episodes)
   - Click on the file you want to edit (e.g., `introduction.Rmd`, `session-1.Rmd`)

2. **Edit the file**:

   - Click the **pencil icon** (‚úèÔ∏è) in the top-right corner of the file view
   - Make your changes directly in the web editor
   - You can preview your changes using the "Preview" tab

3. **Propose your changes**:

   - Scroll down to the "Commit changes" section
   - Add a brief description of what you changed (e.g., "Fix typo in introduction")
   - Click **"Propose changes"**

4. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - GitHub will automatically create a pull request for you
   - Add a more detailed description if needed
   - Click **"Create pull request"**

#### For Other Files:

The same process works for any file in the repository - just navigate to the file and click the edit button.

### üöÄ Option B: Fork and Pull Request (For More Advanced Users)

If you're comfortable with Git and want to make multiple changes or work locally to build and preview the website:

#### Prerequisites:

- Git installed on your computer
- A GitHub account
- R and R Studio Installed on your computer

#### Building and Previewing the Website Locally:

Before making changes, you may want to build and preview the website locally to see how your changes will look:

1. **Install required R packages**:

   ```bash
   # Install sandpaper and varnish from GitHub
   Rscript -e "if (!require('remotes', quietly = TRUE)) install.packages('remotes'); remotes::install_github('carpentries/sandpaper'); remotes::install_github('carpentries/varnish')"
   ```

2. **Install pandoc** (required for building):

   ```bash
   # On macOS with Homebrew
   brew install pandoc

   # On Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install pandoc

   # On Windows, download from https://pandoc.org/installing.html
   ```

3. **Build the website**:

   ```bash
   cd salmon-data-standards-workshop
   Rscript -e "sandpaper::build_lesson()"
   ```

4. **Preview the website**:

   ```bash
   Rscript -e "sandpaper::serve()"
   ```

   Then open your web browser and go to: **http://localhost:4321**

   The website will automatically refresh when you make changes to your source files.

5. **Stop the preview server**:
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running
