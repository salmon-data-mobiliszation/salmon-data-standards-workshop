# Salmon Data Standards Workshop

## Overview

The **Salmon Data Standards Workshop** repository is part of the larger effort by the Salmon Ontology Development Working Group (WG) to enhance data interoperability and usability in salmon science and management. This repository specifically focuses on developing training materials, tools, and ontology modules for the **Salmon Data Standards Workshop**, targeting both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Objectives of the Workshop

The workshop aims to address the challenges of integrating and standardizing salmon-related data by providing participants with the skills and resources to:

1. **Develop Modular Ontologies**  
   - Learn to create small, focused ontology modules for real-world data challenges in salmon science (e.g., summary population estimates, demographic unit naming).  
   - Apply semantic mapping techniques across multiple databases for term alignment.

2. **Hands-On Training**  
   - Engage with tutorials and interactive sessions modeled after **Data Carpentry** workshops.  
   - Use practical tools like **ROBOT**, **LinkML**, and **WebProtégé** to build and publish controlled vocabularies.

3. **Enable Broader Community Adoption**  
   - Contribute to a formalized method for salmon ontology development that aligns with the **NCEAS Salmon Ontology**.  
   - Foster collaboration across agencies, NGOs, indigenous groups, and researchers.

## Who Should Participate?

This workshop is designed for a diverse audience, including:

- **Government fisheries scientists and data managers** aiming to improve data interoperability.  
- **Academic researchers** in salmon ecology and population dynamics.  
- **Indigenous communities and knowledge holders** involved in monitoring and co-management of salmon habitats.  
- **NGOs and grassroots organizations** working on salmon conservation and education.  

No prior experience with ontology development is required! The workshop includes beginner-friendly sessions and step-by-step guidance.

## Deliverables

By the conclusion of the workshop, participants will:

1. **Learn** how to create modular ontologies that align with existing frameworks like the **NCEAS Salmon Ontology**.  
2. **Build** prototype ontology modules addressing specific challenges in salmon science.  
3. **Utilize** tools such as **ROBOT**, **LinkML**, and **WebProtégé** to support vocabulary management and ontology publication.  
4. **Access** reusable training materials for continued learning and application.

## Value Proposition

The workshop directly supports salmon science and management by enabling:

- **Semantic dataset alignment**: Make salmon datasets machine-readable and interoperable.  
- **Cross-jurisdictional integration**: Facilitate data sharing across regions and agencies.  
- **Enhanced decision-making**: Support conservation, stock assessment, and habitat monitoring with better-integrated data.  

These benefits align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly:  
- **Goal 14**: Life Below Water  
- **Goal 15**: Life on Land  
- **Goal 17**: Partnerships for the Goals
