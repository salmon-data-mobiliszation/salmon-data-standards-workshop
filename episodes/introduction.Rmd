:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 
-   What are controlled vocabularies and why are they important for data interoperability?
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
## Introduction

This workshop helps participants collaboratively develop, document, and align controlled vocabularies to improve data interoperability in salmon research and management. It emphasizes practical, community-centered steps that support long-term reusability and transparency, while remaining adaptable to other organizations or domains.

### Why Controlled Vocabularies Matter

Inconsistent terminology prevents data integration and makes shared understanding difficult across agencies, researchers, and Indigenous knowledge systems. Controlled vocabularies address this by:

-   Capturing and standardizing the meaning of key terms

-   Enabling clear documentation and communication

-   Forming the foundation for ontologies and semantic integration

### Learning Approach

This is a Carpentry-style, hands-on workshop. Each module builds on your own data and progresses from discovering terms you already use → documenting them clearly → aligning them with others.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Use `.md` files for episodes when you want static content
- Use `.Rmd` files for episodes when you need to generate output
- Run `sandpaper::check_lesson()` to identify any issues with your lesson
- Run `sandpaper::build_lesson()` to preview your lesson locally
