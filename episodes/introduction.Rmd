### Learning Approach

This is a Carpentry-style, hands-on workshop. Each module builds on your own data and progresses from discovering terms you already use → documenting them clearly → aligning them with others.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction

This workshop helps participants collaboratively develop, document, and align controlled vocabularies to improve data interoperability in salmon research and management. It emphasizes practical, community-centered steps that support long-term reusability and transparency, while remaining adaptable to other organizations or domains.

### Why Controlled Vocabularies Matter

Inconsistent terminology prevents data integration and makes shared understanding difficult across agencies, researchers, and Indigenous knowledge systems. Controlled vocabularies address this by:

-   Capturing and standardizing the meaning of key terms

-   Enabling clear documentation and communication

-   Forming the foundation for ontologies and semantic integration


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

By the end of the first three modules, participants will have:
- Discovered and reused existing terms and URIs.
- Created clear definitions and documentation for local data.
- Built a mapping table connecting their terms to others’.
